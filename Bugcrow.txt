This platform not only provides an opportunity to showcase one's skills and deliver real value to organizations but also to collaborate with some of the industry's top talents.
I successfully cleared my first round in 2023 and was scheduled for the second, but unfortunately, the position was filled before I could proceed. Since then, I have been eagerly waiting for another opportunity to secure this role.

>> Describe why are you passionate about cyber security. (answer in 200-300 words)*
ANS: I originally pursued studies in aviation, but during the lockdown, I discovered my passion for hacking. This interest in infosec led me to abandon my plans of working in the airline industry and instead seek opportunities in cybersecurity.
Despite having no prior knowledge, I secured an internship and continuously learned new methodologies. This field has since given me the opportunity to work with various companies as a service provider and contribute to a wide range of security projects.
